Chapter Title: James B. Cornell enlists in the army during WWII

James stood at the train station, surrounded by tearful goodbyes from his family and friends. His mother clutched his hand tightly, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears, while his father stood tall, a stoic expression masking the worry in his eyes. James's younger sister, Lily, tried to put on a brave face, but her trembling lip betrayed her emotions.

"I'll write to you all the time," James promised, his voice steady despite the lump in his throat. He hugged each family member in turn, trying to memorize the feel of their embrace, the sound of their laughter, and the scent of home that clung to them.

His best friend, Michael, clapped him on the back, a forced smile on his face. "You better come back in one piece, Cornell. We've got a lot of catching up to do when this is all over."

James nodded, swallowing hard. He knew the road ahead would be tough, filled with uncertainty and danger, but he also knew that he couldn't turn back now. As the train whistle blew in the distance, signaling the departure, James gave one last wave to his loved ones before boarding, his heart heavy with the weight of leaving everything he knew behind.

As the train pulled away from the station, James found a seat by the window and watched as the familiar faces of his hometown faded into the distance. The landscape blurred past him, a mix of emotions churning within him - fear, excitement, determination. But above all, there was a sense of purpose that burned bright within his soul, propelling him forward into the unknown with unwavering resolve.
