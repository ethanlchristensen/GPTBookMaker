Chapter Title: Finn and Lilly find Goldie in an unexpected place

Finn and Lilly's steps were light as they made their way back to their dorm, Goldie swimming happily in its makeshift bowl. The campus was bathed in the warm hues of the setting sun, casting long shadows that danced across the cobblestones. The weight of their successful mission hung in the air, a sense of accomplishment mingling with the gentle breeze.

As they reached their dorm room, Finn carefully placed Goldie in a larger bowl, filled with fresh water and adorned with colorful pebbles. Lilly watched with a soft smile, her eyes reflecting the flickering candlelight that illuminated the room. They sat on the floor, their tired but content faces glowing in the warm ambiance.

"Finn, I can't believe we found Goldie in the fountain," Lilly said, breaking the peaceful silence that enveloped them. "It's like fate brought us together."

Finn nodded, his gaze fixed on Goldie as it swam gracefully in its new home. "I agree, Lilly. It's like Goldie was waiting for us to embark on this adventure together."

They sat in companionable silence, the flickering candle casting a soft glow over their faces. Finn reached out and took Lilly's hand, a silent gesture of gratitude for her unwavering support throughout their quest. Together, they basked in the warmth of their success, knowing that their bond had grown stronger through the trials they had faced.

As the night deepened, and the stars began to twinkle outside their window, Finn, Lilly, and Goldie drifted off to sleep, their hearts full of joy and anticipation for the adventures that awaited them in the days to come.
